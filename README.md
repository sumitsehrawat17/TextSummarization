# TextSummarization
he purpose of this project is to produce a model for Abstractive Text Summarization, starting with the RNN encoder-decoder as the baseline model. From there, we come across the effectiveness of different methods for attention in abstractive summarization. These methods try to first understand the text and then rephrase it in a shorter manner, using possibly different words.
