Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image - Getty Images.Vladimir Putin is a \"very weak person\" who won't launch a nuclear attack as it would be \"basically suicide\", the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations believes.A survey from the American Psychological Association (APA) released in March found nearly 70 percent of Americans are concerned the invasion of Ukraine by Russia \"is going to lead to nuclear war\" and that the globe is at \"the beginning stage of World War III\". Since Putin ordered his troops to take Ukraine in late February, a number of developments have caused considerable angst that he could eventually decide to go nuclear. He activated his nuclear deterrence forces within a week of the invasion, which hasn't been going smoothly for Russia. The superpower has failed to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and commentators believe Putin could begin acting more indiscriminately - and take more worrisome actions - the more pushback Russia receives. Just on Saturday, a Ukrainian train station packed with civilians fleeing the conflict was struck by a missile.Ukraine has been pleading for more help from the world, including NATO. However, although nations have sent the eastern European country both lethal and non-lethal aid, while also sanctioning Russia, none have committed troops to fight as it would entangle them in the conflict.The Kremlin in March said it could use nuclear weapons if its existence was threatened. Speaking to Newshub Nation on Saturday, Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya said threats of nuclear war by Russia amount to \"blackmail\". \"I don't believe it's possible. It's suicide to Putin himself,\" said Kyslytsya.\"The nature of Putin, who likes to project an image of being invincible and a brave man, the nature of Putin is he's a very weak person. I don't believe that he wants to kill himself by launching a nuclear attack because it will receive the appropriate reply. That will be basically suicide.\"That's a reference to the doctrine of mutually-assured destruction (MAD) that suggests that any country with nuclear capabilities which is attacked with nuclear weapons will strike back, destroying both. Ukraine no longer has nuclear weapons, but if Russia was to use them against Ukraine, it would likely cause serious retaliation from the West. David Welch, an expert in international security at the Canadian University of Waterloo, told AM last month that whether Putin uses nuclear weapons will come down to what his mental state is. \"It's all sabre-rattling and not serious if Vladimir Putin is rational. If he is stressed out, emotional, losing his capacity to make sound decisions? It's a very worrisome, dangerous situation.\"After Putin raised the nuclear forces alert, US President Joe Biden was directly asked if Americans should be concerned about a nuclear war breaking out. He answered: \"no\". White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki later said the US had assessed Putin's order and \"we see no reason to change our own alert levels\".According to Federation of American Scientists data, Russia and the US hold more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads, with Russia having 5977 and the US having 5428.World wheat prices soared by 19.7% in March as war in Ukraine disrupted Black Sea exports, FAO price index revealsGlobal food prices rose to their highest ever levels in March as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UN has reported.Cooking oils, cereals and meats hit all-time highs and meant food commodities cost a third more than the same time last year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s monthly food price index published on Friday.The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted Black Sea exports of crucial commodities from a region that had been producing more than a quarter of the world’s wheat exports.The war has helped push cereal prices up 17% over the past month with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from Ukraine. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems.World wheat prices soared by 19.7% during March, while maize prices posted a 19.1% month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum.The FAO said these problems were likely to persist, leading to higher prices, lower stocks and uncertainty in the wheat market in the future.“The higher price quotations are particularly concerning for countries already struggling with other crisis, including conflict, natural disasters, economic conditions or, as it is often the case, some combinations of those,” said an FAO spokesperson, adding that countries with low incomes and food shortages may struggle to pay higher prices.“[Price] increases are the most noticeable in the countries where the share in disposable income spent on food is the highest. In these cases, the most vulnerable are likely to skip meals, purchase less nutritious foods, or use other coping strategies, which will have longer term effects on their health and wellbeing.”Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said before the invasion, prices were already near record highs because of limited global supplies.“Projected stock levels were already low relative to recent years, which means that there are few supplies available to buffer the impacts of reduced exports coming from the Black Sea,” he said.IFPRI estimates that Ukraine and Russia accounted for 12% of calories traded in the world.Glauber said the volatility in food prices was being felt everywhere. Countries that were particularly reliant on wheat from Russia and Ukraine may have to switch to the EU, US, Australia, Canada and Argentina for wheat supplies.“Many of these countries are in north Africa and the Middle East where wheat often accounts for as much as 35% of total calories consumed and a majority of the wheat is imported, much from the Black Sea,” he said.The Black Sea region has also been a crucial source for sunflower oil and the limiting of exports has meant vegetable oil prices rising by almost a quarter since February. Prices also rose for palm, soy and rapeseed oils because of increased demand.Earlier this week, the World Food Programme said the effect of blocked exports would hit several countries in east Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan – countries already experiencing severe drought and conflict.WFP said the price of local foods had risen a quarter, on average, compared with last year but had been as high as 92% in Sudan.It also warned that eastern African countries are fully dependent on imports for fertiliser, for which Ukraine and Russia are also a key source, and that disruption could impact local production and push food prices even further up.{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}\n"

Prices also rose for palm, soy and rapeseed oils because of increased demand.Earlier this week, the World Food Programme said the effect of blocked exports would hit several countries in east Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan – countries already experiencing severe drought and conflict.WFP said the price of local foods had risen a quarter, on average, compared with last year but had been as high as 92% in Sudan.It also warned that eastern African countries are fully dependent on imports for fertiliser, for which Ukraine and Russia are also a key source, and that disruption could impact local production and push food prices even further up.{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}'"

            "\"After Putin raised the nuclear forces alert, US President Joe Biden was directly asked if Americans should be concerned about a nuclear war breaking out. \"That's a reference to the doctrine of mutually-assured destruction (MAD) that suggests that any country with nuclear capabilities which is attacked with nuclear weapons will strike back, destroying both. Police said on Twitter the dead man probably mistook the bomb for an old sewage pipe. Speaking to Newshub Nation on Saturday, Ukrainian Ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya said threats of nuclear war by Russia amount to \"blackmail\". Since Putin ordered his troops to take Ukraine in late February, a number of developments have caused considerable angst that he could eventually decide to go nuclear. Ukraine no longer has nuclear weapons, but if Russia was to use them against Ukraine, it would likely cause serious retaliation from the West. He activated his nuclear deterrence forces within a week of the invasion, which hasn't been going smoothly for Russia.\n"
